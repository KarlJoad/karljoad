# Hey!

I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in Northwestern University's Computer Engineering department.

My primary interests lie in further blurring the hardware/software interface by co-designing each of them for the other.
In practice, this means I
  * Create new hardware for specialty purposes, like making interrupts faster.
  * Design accelerators to execute a software intermediate representation in hardware.

Because of all the hardware design work I do, I also have a vested interest in making hardware easier to write, easier to write correctly the first time, and easier to debug when wrong.
